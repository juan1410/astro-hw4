Hello everyone, this is my very first blog post and I have been finding the Astro site to be very **interesting** and **fun** as well. Below are some of my thoughts on Astro.

### Why I Like Astro
- **Clean separation** between layout and content with built-in Markdown support
- **Integration with modern tools** like Tailwind, View Transitions, and static rendering

### What I Built
In this blog, you're looking at a full Astro project, complete with:
- Reusable layouts and components
- Markdown-powered pages
- Transition animations
- Design very similar to my portfolio site

This assignment has helped me understand the deeper value of static site generators — both for class assignments and future personal sites.

> If you're new to Astro, I highly recommend starting with their [official docs](https://docs.astro.build) — it's a very very helpful site.

Stay tuned for more blog posts.
